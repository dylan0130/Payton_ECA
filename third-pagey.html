    <p>I personally think The Unhoneymooners is an 8.5/10-star book. It was a very good plot and it was an amazing book in general but there are some aspects that just made it lower than a 10/10.</p>
      <p>For starters the fact that there was angst in the last few chapters had me literally biting my nails and on the edge of my seat. I was beyond stressed.
      Until they ended up being okay in the end so it made the book worth reading.</p>
      <p> Basically the plot is we have 2 sisters, one named Ami who is a winner at almost everything and is like the perfect child. Then there is Olive who is the opposite. Fast forward Ami is getting
      married to this guy named Dane. Dane has an older brother named Ethan. Ethan and Olive request a separate meal at the wedding due to their pickiness. Turns out everyone at the wedding got food
      poisoning, except for Olive and Ethan, of course. Since Ami won her honeymoon in a contest and the tickets, hotel, and everything was not refundable she asked that Olive and Ethan go on the honeymoon instead.
      Mind you Ethan and Olive hate each other!! Anyway after a bunch of convincing, Olive and Ethan act as a fake married couple and go on the honeymoon. At first their miserable but eventually they develop feelings 
      for each other and fall in love blah blah blah.</p>
      <p> BUT THEN. They come back from the honeymoon and since they are all lovely dovey now they kiss while at their baggage claim. AND GUESS WHO SAW. AMI AND DANE. CRAY CRAY RIGHT?? anyway, Ami is in shock while Dane 
      is oddly excited for them. So everything goes great for a while UNTILLL. One night Dane, Ami, Olive, and Ethan agree to go to a bar together. Ethan, Olive, and Dane were already there while Ami was running a little behind.
      Ethan had to run to the bathroom so I did so. It was all okay until flipping Dane said some sexual and inappropriate things to Olive. When Ethan comes back Olive walks out of the bar while Ethan follows. When Ethan tries to stop 
      Olive, Olive explains to him what happened BUT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE HER. So then they argue and have all kinds of problems. Until cutie patootie Ethan apologizes and then they're all good again!! And then he proposes to her on the beach 
      a few years later and there's the best Enemies to Lovers book ever!</p>
