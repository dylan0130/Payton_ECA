    <h1>About Them</h1>
    <p>Christina Lauren is actually 2 different people with their names combined. Christina Hobbs and Lauren Billing 
      are best friends who work together to create each book of theirs. </p>
    <h2>Why I am making this website</h2>
    <p>I personally love Christina Lauren's books. Though I've read very few I really love their writing style and their genre of books. </p>
