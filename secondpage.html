    <h2>About Them</h2>
    <p>Christina Lauren is actually 2 different people with their names combined. Christina Hobbs and Lauren Billing 
      are best friends who work together to create each book of theirs. </p>
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p> I've just recently begun to read books again. I wasn't a big reading person until January when ironically I read a book by Christina Lauren 
      and instantly was obsessed with her books. Obviously, I've read books from other authors but I have read a majority of their books.</p>
    <h2>Why I am making this website</h2>
    <p>I personally love Christina Lauren's books. Though I've read very few I really love their writing style and their genre of books. </p>
